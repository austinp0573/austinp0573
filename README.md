# Austin Porter

Recent Computer Science graduate with a focus on systems, infrastructure, and backend development. I enjoy working on practical projects that involve Linux systems, networking, and cloud technologies.

## About Me

I'm interested in roles involving software engineering, cloud infrastructure, platform engineering, and networking. I like building things that solve real problems and learning new technologies by getting hands-on with them.

Currently working on expanding my homelab setup with Proxmox, pfSense, and various self-hosted services to develop practical skills in infrastructure and deployment.

## Technical Skills

**Languages:** Python, Java, C#/.NET, SQL, C++, Shell scripting

**Technologies & Tools:** 
- Linux system administration
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes (learning)
- AWS (basic experience)
- Ansible, Terraform, Packer
- Spring Boot, .NET frameworks
- YOLO/computer vision
- Networking (switches, routers, firewalls, wireless APs)

**Hardware:** Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, various microcontrollers, PCB design

## Featured Projects

### [NVDA Close Predictor](https://github.com/austinp0573/nvda_close_predictor)
Machine learning project that predicts NVIDIA stock closing prices. Built with Python and Jupyter notebooks, implements time series prediction using historical market data.

### [Debian 13 NVIDIA Drivers](https://github.com/austinp0573/debian13_nvidia_drivers)
Shell script for installing NVIDIA proprietary drivers on fresh Debian 13 installations. Actively maintained and used by others in the community. Currently pinned to 580 drivers due to stability issues with newer driver releases.

### [Person Detection System](https://github.com/austinp0573/PersonDetection)
Real-time person detection using YOLO11 on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super. Implemented in C#/.NET 8 with automated email alerts. Demonstrates edge computing and computer vision applications.

### [Terraform Proxmox K8s](https://github.com/austinp0573/terraform-proxmox-k8s)
Infrastructure as Code project that provisions Kubernetes cluster VMs on Proxmox using Terraform, then generates Ansible inventory for configuration management.

### [GNSS Breakout Board](https://github.com/austinp0573/Hardware)
Designed and assembled a custom PCB for GNSS applications. Not my primary focus area, but I think this demonstrates hardware design fundamentals and breadth of my technical interests.

## What I'm Learning

- Kubernetes cluster management and high availability configurations
- AWS cloud services and architecture
- Advanced networking with pfSense and enterprise routing
- Self-hosting and infrastructure automation
